# Evidence Summary Template — Markdown-First Approach

## Strategy

Write the evidence summary as a **Markdown file** first, then convert to .docx using
pandoc with a styled reference template. This keeps the agent focused on clinical content
quality rather than formatting.

## Why Markdown First?

- The agent writes natural structured text instead of JavaScript
- Clickable hyperlinks work natively: `[link text](https://...)`
- In-text citations are just `[1]` in plain text
- Tables work in standard markdown
- Pandoc produces clean .docx that opens reliably in Microsoft Word
- The reference template handles fonts, colours, heading styles, and page layout
- Content is easy to review and debug before conversion

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Write the evidence summary as Markdown

Create a file called `[Topic_Name]_Evidence_Summary_[Year].md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Evidence Summary: [Topic]"
subtitle: "Systematic Literature Search"
author: "Clinical Literature Search — AI-Assisted Analysis"
date: "[Month Year]"
---

\newpage

> **DRAFT — NOT FOR CLINICAL USE**
>
> This is an AI-generated draft document. It has not been verified by a clinician
> and must not be used for clinical decision-making until it has been reviewed,
> cross-checked, and approved by a qualified professional.
>
> **To approve this document:** (1) review all evidence summaries and references,
> (2) delete this callout, (3) complete the "Reviewed and approved by" field in
> the Transparency Disclaimer (section 5).

# 1. Search Strategy

**Databases searched:** PubMed, Scholar Gateway
**Date range:** [start] to [end]
**MeSH terms:** [list]
**Publication types prioritised:** Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, RCTs, large registry studies
**Guideline bodies consulted:** [list with editions/dates]
**Total references included:** [N]

# 2. National Guidelines

## 2.1 [Guideline Body — e.g., BTS Guidelines for X, Nth Edition (Year)]

[Key recommendations with evidence grades. ALWAYS include the grade — e.g.,
"BTS recommends target titre <1:8 at transplantation (Grade 1C)"]

## 2.2 [Next Guideline Body]

[...]

# 3. Recent Evidence

## 3.1 [Subtopic — e.g., Drug Dosing]

[Papers grouped by subtopic. Summarise key findings with in-text citations:
"A recent meta-analysis [3] found no difference in outcomes. A UK registry
study confirmed this [7]."]

## 3.2 [Next Subtopic]

[...]

# 4. Conflicting Recommendations

[Include this section only if guidelines disagree with each other or if recent
evidence contradicts a current guideline. Present both positions with evidence
grades. Example:

"BTS recommends X (Grade 1C) while KDIGO suggests Y (Grade 2D). The discrepancy
reflects differing interpretations of [study]. A recent RCT [N] found Z, which
supports the BTS position but was published after the current KDIGO guideline."

Omit this section entirely if there are no conflicts to report.]

# 5. Emerging Evidence (Preprints)

[Include this section only if medRxiv/bioRxiv preprints were found in Step 3b.
Label each preprint clearly as "(preprint, not peer-reviewed)". Example:

"A recent medRxiv preprint (Smith et al., 2026; preprint, not peer-reviewed)
reports outcomes from a single-centre series of 45 patients..."

Omit this section entirely if no preprints were found or the bioRxiv MCP
was not available.]

# 6. Evidence Gaps

[Areas where evidence is limited or absent. Identify:
- Questions with no RCT data
- Topics covered only by single-centre studies
- Emerging areas with only preliminary data
- If ongoing trials were found (Step 3b), list them here with NCT numbers,
  phase, sample size, and expected completion dates]

# 7. Transparency Disclaimer

*This evidence summary was produced using AI-assisted literature search (Claude, Anthropic)
with PubMed and Scholar Gateway searches. The AI system was used for literature retrieval
and structured analysis; clinical interpretation remains the responsibility of the
reviewing clinician. References have been verified against PubMed metadata.*

**Reviewed and approved by:** ______________________ *(name, title, and institution)*

*AI system metadata: clinical-evidence v[plugin version] · [model identifier] · PubMed MCP · Scholar Gateway · Search date [YYYY-MM-DD]*

*Plugin repository: [github.com/Laszlo75/clinical-skills](https://github.com/Laszlo75/clinical-skills) — copy this link exactly, do not substitute a different repository URL. Read `[plugin version]` from `../../.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at document-generation time.*

# 8. References

1. Author AB, Author CD, et al. Title of the article. *Journal Name*.
   Year;Vol(Issue):Pages. PMID: 12345678.
   [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1234/example)

2. British Transplantation Society. Guidelines for Antibody Incompatible
   Transplantation, Third Edition. February 2016.
   [BTS Guidelines](https://bts.org.uk/guidelines-standards/)

3. [Continue numbering sequentially...]
```

### 2. Convert to .docx using pandoc

The skill bundles a `reference.docx` template (in the `assets/` directory) that sets
Arial font, A4 page size, navy headings, headers/footers, and page numbers.

```bash
pandoc "[Topic_Name]_Evidence_Summary_[Year].md" \
  -o "[Topic_Name]_Evidence_Summary_[Year].docx" \
  --reference-doc="[skill-path]/assets/reference.docx" \
  --from=markdown+yaml_metadata_block \
  --to=docx
```

The YAML frontmatter (`title`, `subtitle`, `author`, `date`) is rendered as a title
block on the first page by pandoc. The `\newpage` after the frontmatter forces the
search strategy section onto page 2, creating a clean title page.

### 3. Also produce the .bib and PMIDs.txt files

After the markdown and docx are done, generate:

**`[Topic_Name]_References.bib`** — BibTeX file:
```bibtex
@article{AuthorYear,
  author  = {Last, First and Last2, First2},
  title   = {Article title},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year    = {2024},
  volume  = {36},
  pages   = {100--110},
  pmid    = {12345678},
  doi     = {10.1234/example}
}
```

If two references share the same `AuthorYear` key (e.g., two Smith2024 papers),
append a lowercase letter: `Smith2024a`, `Smith2024b`.

**`[Topic_Name]_PMIDs.txt`** — one PMID per line:
```
12345678
23456789
34567890
```

## Key Content Rules

### Evidence grades — do not skip

Every recommendation backed by a national guideline MUST include the evidence grade
inline. This is what clinicians look for first. Examples:

- "BTS recommends target titre <1:8 at transplantation **(Grade 1C)**"
- "NICE recommends DOACs over warfarin for non-valvular AF **(Strength: Strong)**"
- "KDIGO suggests monitoring DSA quarterly **(Grade 2C)**"

### In-text citations — every claim needs a source

Use numbered references in square brackets: `[1]`, `[2, 3]`, `[4-6]`.
Every reference in the list must be cited at least once in the body.
Every factual claim in the summary must cite its source.

### Clickable links in references — essential

In the markdown, write each reference with its DOI or URL as a clickable link:

```markdown
1. Smith AB, et al. Title. *Journal*. 2024;36:100. PMID: 12345678.
   [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1234/example)
```

Pandoc converts these to clickable hyperlinks in the .docx automatically.

### Reference accuracy — copy DOIs from PubMed, never from memory

Every DOI in the reference list MUST come directly from the `get_article_metadata`
output for that PMID. DOIs are opaque strings — you cannot reconstruct them from the
paper title or journal. If you write a DOI from memory, it will almost certainly point
to the wrong paper or be a dead link.

When writing the reference list, work from the reference ledger you built during the
search phase. Copy DOIs, titles, and author lists exactly as PubMed returned them.

### Guidelines in the reference list

National guidelines (BTS, NICE, KDIGO, etc.) must appear as numbered entries
in the reference list, just like PubMed papers. Use the guideline body's URL:

```markdown
15. British Transplantation Society. Guidelines for Antibody Incompatible
    Transplantation, 3rd Edition. 2016.
    [BTS Guidelines](https://bts.org.uk/guidelines-standards/)
```

## Output Files

The skill should produce **four** user-facing files in the researcher's workspace folder:

1. **`[Topic_Name]_Evidence_Summary_[Year].md`** — the markdown source
2. **`[Topic_Name]_Evidence_Summary_[Year].docx`** — the converted Word document
3. **`[Topic_Name]_References.bib`** — BibTeX for Zotero import
4. **`[Topic_Name]_PMIDs.txt`** — PMID list for bulk Zotero import

A fifth file, the hidden reference ledger `.literature_search_ledger.yaml`, is written to the workspace during the search (Steps 2–4 of the skill workflow) and left in place at the end. It is an internal artifact used for quality control and downstream-skill handoff. **Do not mention it to the researcher** in the evidence summary document or in any user-facing listing.
